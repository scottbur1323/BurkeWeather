## Deployed
Visit deployed site: https://burkeweatherb2p.firebaseapp.com/#/## Galvanize Web App

### Instructions
Are you tired of having loading issues with your weather app when cell phone service isn't the best?  Try our very low memory free and open source weather app.  Simply enter your current zip code and let BurkeWeather tell you the current weather conditions.  You even get a bonus NASA map of your zip code location.

### Future of app
BurkeWeather remains a living and breathing app.  It is on my radar for future updates and features that will refine the web app.  Some future ideas include:
  * Adding pictures/icons of certain weather conditions that will dynamically be displayed.
  * Offering to the user to let the browser determine their location.
  * Adding a predictive weather broken up weekly, daily or hourly.
